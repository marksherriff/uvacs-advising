## Overview

Faculty from the Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering
Departments jointly administer the CpE undergraduate degree program. The
curriculum has been carefully designed to assure that students obtain an
excellent background in both disciplines.

What does a Computer Engineer do? We work with hardware and software to create
modern computing and embedded systems. Graduates of the Bachelors of Science in
Computer Engineering Program are successful practitioners and innovators in
computer engineering and other fields. Our students learn to analyze, design and
implement creative solutions to problems with computer hardware, software,
systems and applications. They contribute effectively as team members,
communicate clearly and interact responsibly with colleagues, clients, employers
and society.


## Undergraduate Record

The official undergraduate record contains the official rules for completing the
degree program. If there is any disagreement between these pages and the rules
in the undergraduate record, the record is the final authority.

## Declaring the Major

Students declare their major in the School of Engineering and Applied Science
either in their second semester if they entered the school as a first year
student or upon transfer to the School. More information can be found on the
[SEAS page for major declaration](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/content.php?catoid=54&navoid=4326#Major_Minor).


## Degree Requirements

All students completing the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering
must fulfill the following requirements.

### School of Engineering and Applied Science General Requirements

CpE students must complete the unified set of general requirements for all
engineering majors. More information can be found on the SEAS Curricular
Requirements page. These courses are often completed during the first two years
in SEAS, with the exception of STS 4500 and 4600, which are taken during the
fall and spring of the fourth year, respectively.

### Capstone

CpE majors must take ECE 4440 to fulfill the capstone requirement.

- ECE 4440 - Embedded System Design (Credits: 4.5)

### Science/Math Elective

Chosen from: BIOL 2100, 2200; CHEM 1420; approved APMA course; MSE 2090; and
PHYS 2620.

### STS Elective

Any course which meets the Second Writing Requirement as specified in the
College of Arts & Sciences (CLAS) may be substituted for STS 2XXX/3XXX.

### Unrestricted Electives

CpE majors must complete twelve (12) credits of unrestricted electives.
APMA 1090 counts as three-credit unrestricted elective. Other unrestricted
electives may be chosen from any graded course in the University except the
following mathematics courses: MATH 1310, STAT 1100 and STAT 1120 or any course
that substantially duplicate any others offered for the degree including PHYS
2010, 2020; CS 1010, 1020; or any introductory programming course. Students in
