## CS Student Mailing Lists

All Undergrad CS Students Department List (cs-ugrads@virginia.edu): A list called cs-ugrads@virginia.edu is used to send important messages to all our undergraduate computing majors (BSCS, BACS, and BSCpE majors). At least once a year, we update these lists and add all our majors.

## CS Department Contacts

* General questions and help: [cs-office@virginia.edu](mailto:cs-office@virginia.edu)
* BSCS Director: [bscsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bscsdirector@virginia.edu)
* BACS Director: [bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu)
* CS Minor Director: [csminordirector@virginia.edu](mailto:csminordirector@virginia.edu)

## SEAS Student Support Team
You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help! 

__NOTE:__ While the contacts in this section are in the SEAS Dean's office, College students can approach them. You should make it clear you're a CS student in the College, and if they are not able help you they certainly should be able to point you to someone in the College or elsewhere who can.

## SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
Students with disabilities may wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at [cmacmasters@virginia.edu](mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu) to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: [sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu](http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu). 


## Religious Accommodations
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to their instructor by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200.

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

## Community and Identity
The [Center for Diversity in Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/about-our-school/diversity-equity-and-engagement/center-diversity-engineering) (CDE) is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world.  The CDE includes an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.

## Statement on Violence
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.  

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  [UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009) based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. [UVA policy](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010) also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. 

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to [Just Report It](https://justreportit.virginia.edu/) (justreportit.virginia.edu) or [contact EOCR](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu), the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to [Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”)](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps) and [Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/confidential-advocates) (for students of all genders).
