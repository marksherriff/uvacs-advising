# Artificial Intelligence Focal Path

The Department of Computer Science offers an Artificial Intelligence Focal Path-- a curated sequence of four courses designed for students who want to take a focused area of study in AI. More information is found [on this page](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science/cs-undergraduate-artificial-intelligence-focal-path).

A focal path is a selection of courses that a student can take to demonstrate they have fulfilled a set of courses the department has defined for that area of focus in computing. Unlike a second major or minor, it does not appear on the transcript.  Once the courses are completed, the student can apply for a Letter of Completion from the department. Courses that count for the focal path can also count for any other major or minor requirement.
