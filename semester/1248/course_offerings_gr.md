# CS Graduate Courses for Fall 2024

__Last Updated: Monday, March 25__

Please see [Lou's List](https://louslist.org/page.php?Semester=1242&Type=Group&Group=CompSci) for the most up-to-date information regarding course offerings.

## Special Topics Courses

__CS 6501-001: Human-Computer Interaction__ w/ Prof. Seongkook Heo - _"This course will focus on research methods for Human-Computer Interaction, including the research contributions in HCI and qualitative and quantitative study methods."_

__CS 6501-002: Wireless Sensing in IoT__ w/ Prof. Kun Qian - _"Wireless sensing technologies repurpose wireless signals for sensing physical environment and gaining situational awareness. Formed by pervasive wirelessly connected devices, the IoT can be turned into a universal sensor network with wireless sensing, enabling the vision of ambient intelligence. This course covers the wireless sensing basics (e.g., radar, Wi-Fi) and cutting-edge applications (e.g., motion tracking, activity recognition, environmental sensing). The evaluation will be based on assignments, a course project, a mid-term exam, and a final presentation."_

__CS 6501-003: Smart and Healthy Buildings__ w/ Prof. Brad Campbell - _"This class focuses the next generation of buildings where smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, machine learning applications, and simulations platforms will help us understand the changes in indoor environments and occupantsâ€™ needs, allowing building systems to dynamically enhance the indoor environmental conditions from health, comfort, and energy perspectives. This course will familiarize students with smart building concepts, terminology, tools and techniques needed to make our future buildings adjust to our needs and energy demands. Specifically, students will gain hands-on experience with real test beds to build and deploy smart building applications that will better support occupants."_

__CS 6501-004: TBD__ w/ TBD  

__CS 6501-005: Machine Learning in Image Analysis__ w/ Prof. Miaomiao Zhang - _"This course focuses on an in-depth study of advanced topics and interests in image data analysis. Students will learn practical image techniques and gain mathematical fundamentals in machine learning needed to build their own models for effective problem solving. Topics of image denoising/reconstruction, deformable image registration, data dimensionality reduction, generative models, and deep neural networks for image segmentation/classification will be covered. The main focus might change from semester to semester. The graduate students (CS 6501 / ECE 6782) will be given additional programming tasks and more advanced theoretical questions."_

__CS 6501-006: TBD__ w/ Prof. Dave Evans

__CS 6501-007: Learning for Interactive Robots__ w/ Prof. Yen-Ling Kuo

__CS 6501-008: 3D Computer Vision__ w/ Zezhou Cheng - _"The ability to perceive the world in 3D is critically important for humans and has extensive applications in robotics, graphics, virtual/augmented reality, and more. This course will delve into the foundational concepts and recent advancements at the intersection of machine learning and 3D computer vision. Topics include classical multi-view geometry, explicit and implicit 3D representations, differentiable rendering, 3D perception, and motion understanding."_ 

__CS 6501-009: Convex Optimization for Engineering & Data Science__ w/ Prof. Jundong Li

__CS 6501-010: Autonomous Mobile Robots__ w/ Prof. Nicola Bezzo

__CS 6501-011: Intro NLP__ w/ Prof. Yangfeng Ji - _"Natural language processing (NLP) seeks to provide computers with the ability to process and understand human language intelligently. Examples of NLP techniques include (i) automatically translating from one natural language to another, (ii) analyzing documents to answer related questions or make related predictions, and (iii) generating texts to help story writing or build conversational agents. This course, consisting of one fundamental part and one advanced part, will give an overview of modern NLP techniques."_

__CS 6501-012: Cloud System Reliability__ w/ Prof. Chang Lou - _"In this course we discuss reliability challenges in cloud systems and software techniques to address them. This is a reading-based seminar course with a course project. No exam."_

__CS 6501-013: Geometry of Data__ w/ Prof. Tom Fletcher

__CS 6501-014: Computational Behavior Modelng__ w/ Prof. Afsaneh Doryab

__CS 6501-015: TBD__ w/ TBD
