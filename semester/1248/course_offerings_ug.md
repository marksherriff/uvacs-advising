# CS Undergrad Courses for Fall 2024

__Last Updated: Tuesday, April 2__

Please see [Lou's List](https://louslist.org/page.php?Semester=1242&Type=Group&Group=CompSci) for the most up-to-date information regarding course offerings.

## Special Topics Courses

__CS 4501-001: Privacy in the Internet Age__ w/ Prof. Yixin Sun

__CS 4501-002: Natural Language Processing__ w/ Prof. Yu Meng - _"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly evolving field in artificial intelligence (AI) with wide-ranging applications in our daily life. This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of NLP."_

__CS 4501-003: Smart and Healthy Buildings__ w/ Prof. Brad Campbell - _"This class focuses the next generation of buildings where smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, machine learning applications, and simulations platforms will help us understand the changes in indoor environments and occupantsâ€™ needs, allowing building systems to dynamically enhance the indoor environmental conditions from health, comfort, and energy perspectives. This course will familiarize students with smart building concepts, terminology, tools and techniques needed to make our future buildings adjust to our needs and energy demands. Specifically, students will gain hands-on experience with real test beds to build and deploy smart building applications that will better support occupants."_

__CS 4501-004: Reinforcement Learning__ w/ Prof. Shangtong Zhang

__CS 4501-005: Machine Learning in Image Analysis__ w/ Prof. Miaomiao Zhang - _"This course focuses on an in-depth study of advanced topics and interests in image data analysis. Students will learn practical image techniques and gain mathematical fundamentals in machine learning needed to build their own models for effective problem solving. Topics of image denoising/reconstruction, deformable image registration, data dimensionality reduction, generative models, and deep neural networks for image segmentation/classification will be covered. The main focus might change from semester to semester. The graduate students (CS 6501 / ECE 6782) will be given additional programming tasks and more advanced theoretical questions."_

__CS 4501-006: F1/10 Autonomous Vehicles__ w/ Prof. Madhur Bell
