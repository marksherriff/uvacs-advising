# CS Minor

The information on this page is intended for students who newly declared the CS minor starting in the fall of 2021.  Students who declared before this time (or have previously taken CS 2110) should contact the department for more information.

## CS Minor Requirements

The Computer Science minor requires credit for five CS courses as described below. Any undergraduate student in the university who has completed CS 2100 with a C- or better can apply for the minor.  

To obtain a minor in computer science, a student must complete the following requirements:

* Prerequisite: CS 1110, CS 1111, CS 1112, CS 1113, or passed the CS 1110 Placement Test
* [CS 2100 - Data Structures and Algorithms 1]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-2100-data-structures-and-algorithms-1) (Credits: 4)
* [CS 2120 - Discrete Mathematics and Theory 1]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-2120-discrete-mathematics-and-theory-1) (Credits: 3)
* [CS 2130 - Computer Systems and Organization 1]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-2130-computer-systems-and-organization-1) (Credits: 4)
* [CS 3140 - Software Development Essentials]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-3140-software-development-essentials) (Credits: 3)
* One [CS Elective]({{ baseurl }}/policies.html#cs-elective-policy) (Credits: 3)^

_^Note: CS Minors can also take CS 3100, CS 3120, CS 3140, or CS 3240 as their CS Elective if they so choose._

### Notes About the Minor

* Students with a computer science or computer engineering major are ineligible for the CS minor.
* Students in the College of Arts and Sciences cannot use a course to satisfy both a minor and a major requirement. A course can only count towards the minor or the major, but not both. 
* Any student who completes all of the requirements for a minor in Computer Science before graduation will be awarded the minor if they submit the minor request form at the beginning of their graduation semester.

## Declaring the CS Minor

The CS Minor is a SEAS minor, even for students who are not in SEAS.  Thus, any student applying for the minor must use the following online DocuSign form: [Minor Declaration Form â€“ School of Engineering & Applied Science](https://na2.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=3d7d67ed-1b4c-4df6-a1c7-1acf25b76be9&env=na2&acct=a8970e23-de25-4821-8826-64a7afe0662b&v=2).  Please note that in order to be approved for the CS Minor, students must have a major declared in SIS.
