## New Process for Advising for BACS and BSCS Majors during Spring 2024

The CS department is using a new process for advising BACS and BSCS majors before course registration for Fall 2024 begins.  In the past every student was required to see their faculty advisor to get their registration hold released. But this time things are different, so please read the following carefully.

## Holds on your Registration

You may have a department __advising hold__  that must get removed before you can register. You may have a hold added by someone other than CS (e.g. financial aid) that will stop you registering. __Important:__ you must take are of all holds before your sign-up time, as CS courses fill up very quickly and a delay in signing up can have a serious impact.

*New this term!* Some students will have their __CS department advising holds__ removed automatically by April 1 without needing to see their advisor. Each CS major will be in one of three groups:

* __Newly-declared majors:__  First-year BSCS majors and BACS majors who declared after 10/1/2023 will be emailed about attending one of many group advising meetings. We'll record who attends, and your hold will be released. If you don't attend one of these, you'll need to see your faculty advisor before you're allowed to register for fall courses.
* __Students needing extra support:__ Some majors have been identified as needing some extra support through advising. We are emailing these students, who will need to meet with the department advising coordinator (SJ Jimenez) before they can register.
* __All other students__ will have their hold removed automatically by April 1 without needing to see their advisor. But, these students are encouraged to see their advisor or get assistance from another source, as appropriate.  See below for more info!

## Who to See for Certain Kinds of Advising or Help

Many majors assume their faculty advisor is the best person to answer every kind of question, but that's not often the case. UVA and CS have specialized opportunities for getting help, as described below.  Also, see our [main page on advising]({{ baseurl }}/advising.html) about getting help about a particular issue.

* __CS department's Advising Coordinator, SJ Jimenez__:  SJ is a staff person in CS who takes the lead on supporting students with advising questions and helping the department better meet student needs. Students can contact SJ if they have particularly tricky issues (even those associated with "life" issues rather than academics). If SJ is not the person to handle your problem, they can get you to the right person. SJ is in Rice 420 with walk-in office hours posted on the door, or email [smj4z@virginia.edu](mailto:smj4z@virginia.edu)
* __CS student Ambassadors:__ These are students CS has hired and trained to help provide advising information. They can give a "student view" and know to whom to direct any questions they can't answer. They're available at the walk-in table in the 4th floor Rice Hall common area for most of the day Monday-Friday.
* __Your CS Faculty Advisor:__ CS faculty can talk to you about the field of computing in general, especially areas of advanced study or research. If you're thinking about research or grad school, they're a great resource. And if you're just looking to make a personal connection with a faculty member, don't hesitate to visit them during office hours etc. to say hello or just to talk. And if you have a question they can't answer, they'll know who you can contact.  You can find when your faculty advisor will be available on this page: [CS Faculty Advisor Availability](https://myuva-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/tbh3f_virginia_edu/ERsaJ2DKmNxMiN_047hwlxoBEQTMpYD2J1MSclVcwDNUTg)
* __The BACS or BSCS Program Director:__ The Program Directors in CS can help with more complex issues beyond the "routine", including those require coordination with the Deans office or other departments.
    * BSCS Director: [Mark Sherriff, bscsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bscsdirector@virginia.edu)
    * BACS Director: [Tom Horton, bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu)
    * BSCpE Director: [Mircea Stan, mircea@virginia.edu](mircea@virginia.edu)
* __Questions about General Education Requirements?__
    * For BACS majors, your Association Dean is the one to ask about general education requirements, not anyone in the CS department.
    * For SEAS majors, if one of the CS resources listed here can't help, contact [Jesse Rogers, Undergrad Registrar](jr7up@virginia.edu).
* __Career, Job, Internship issues:__ All our majors have access to the [Engineering Career Development Center](https://engineering.virginia.edu/offices-programs/center-engineering-career-development). They’re the experts hired to help computing students with all that!  They have Drop-In Hours: Tuesday - Thursday 1:30 - 3:00pm, Thornton Hall A-Wing
* __Other things, like rooms, SIS issues, or you just don't know:__ CS has a large staff who solve can help with many things or can forward to the right person! [cs-office@virginia.edu](mailto:cs-office@virginia.edu)
* __Search this website!__ You're on the CS Advising website, which has a ton of answers and helpful info. Use the search bar at the top of each page if the links on the left don't help you find what you need.
    * In particular, see the page [Getting Help / Advising]({{ baseurl }}/advising.html) which has info about study abroad, SDAC, transfer courses, etc.
